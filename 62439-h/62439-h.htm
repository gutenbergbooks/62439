<h2><i>The Creation of the World.</i></h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus1.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">In</span> six days God created the whole
world out of nothing; that is to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
say, the heavens, the earth, fire, air,
water, birds, beasts, fish, and every
creeping thing. He made man also out
of the dust of the earth, and called his
name <i>Adam</i>. And unto <i>Adam</i> he gave
power over the fish of the sea, the
fowls of the air, the cattle, and every
thing that moved upon the face of the
earth. And <i>Adam</i> was planted in the
garden of <i>Eden</i> to dress it, and keep it,
and was perfectly happy there: for he
knew no sin.</p>

<h2><i>Adam and Eve.</i></h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus2.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">Adam</span> had not been long in the
garden of <i>Eden</i>, before God
Almighty thought fit to increase his
happiness, and considering he was
alone, threw him into a deep sleep,
and took out one of his ribs, from
which he formed <i>Eve</i>, a more beautiful
creature than himself, and allotted her
to be a help-meet for him. <i>Adam</i>, at
first sight of this new and lovely companion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
cried out with extacy of joy,
<i>Bone art thou of my bone, and flesh of
my flesh</i>. In this state of bliss they
lived but a short time; for <i>Satan</i>, envying
their happiness, tempted the woman
to eat of the fruit of the tree of
knowledge, which God, to make trial
of their obedience, had strictly charged
them not to touch. The artful insinuations
of the <i>serpent</i>, together with the
beauty of the fruit, prevailed on her to
transgress the divine law. She tasted,
and was highly delighted, and by her
winning behaviour, tempted her husband
to eat also. No sooner had they
swallowed down the gilded bait, but
their eyes were opened, they saw they
were naked, and, conscious of their
guilt, endeavoured to hide themselves
in the garden from the wrath of their
offended Creator; but he soon drove
them from their secret recess; turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
them out of their seat of bliss, and denounced
thereupon not only a heavy
curse upon the <i>serpent</i>, but on them
likewise, though with this ray of mercy
in his anger, <i>that the seed of the woman
should bruise the</i> serpent’s <i>head</i>.</p>

<h2><i>Noah’s Ark.</i></h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus3.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">Of</span> all <i>Adam’s</i> sons, <i>Seth</i> was the
best. He and his sons called on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the name of the Lord; but in process
of time, man indulging himself in all
manner of riot and excess, God repented
that he had made him; and determined
to destroy the whole world by
an universal flood. <i>Noah</i>, however,
who was one of <i>Seth’s</i> posterity, found
grace in the eyes of the Lord. Whereupon
God commanded him to build an
ark of sufficient bulk for the reception
of himself, his family, and two of each
species of animals. No sooner were they
entered than the windows of the heavens
were opened, and it rained heavily
for forty days and forty nights. By
this general deluge every living substance
was destroyed, except <i>Noah</i>, his
wife, his three sons and their wives,
and the other creatures that were admitted
with them into the ark. But soon
after the deluge ceased, the earth was
stocked with inhabitants by the three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
sons of <i>Noah</i>, viz. <i>Shem, Ham, and
Japheth</i>.</p>

<h2><i>The Tower of Babel.</i></h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus4.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">Soon</span> after the sons of <i>Noah</i> had
replenished the earth with inhabitants,
they assembled together in the
fruitful plains of <i>Shinar</i>, where they erected
the lofty Tower of <i>Babel</i>, and
vainly attempted to raise its walls to
the very skies, in hopes to make their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
names immortal; but God Almighty
soon baffled their impious and ill-concerted
project, confused their language
so that they could not understand each
other, and scattered and dispersed them
in various tribes all round the world.</p>

<h2><i>Solomon’s Temple.</i></h2>

<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">God</span> Almighty having blessed <i>Solomon</i>
the son of <i>David</i> (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
wisest of all men) with peace and plenty,
he determined to build a magnificent
temple to the Lord on mount <i>Moriah</i>.
For which purpose he sent to <i>Hiram</i>,
king of <i>Tyre</i>, his father’s ancient friend,
for cedar wood, and other materials requisite
for the accomplishment of his
pious design. All things being duly
prepared, he erected a stately fabric
three stories high, and embellished it
within and without with a vast variety
of fine carved works, profusely overlaid
with gold. As soon as the whole
was complete, <i>Solomon</i> summoned a
numerous assembly of <i>Israelites</i>, and
with the utmost pomp and splendour,
dedicated this glorious building, by
prayer and supplication, to the only true
God.</p>

<h2><i>The Nativity &amp; Passion of our blessed Saviour.</i></h2>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illus6.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">When</span> <i>Herod</i> reigned in <i>Judea</i>,
and <i>Augustus Cæsar</i> was emperor
of <i>Rome</i>, there dwelt at <i>Nazareth</i>,
a small city of <i>Galilee</i>, in the <i>Holy Land</i>,
a Virgin whose name was <i>Mary</i>: God
Almighty sent <i>Gabriel</i>, one of his favourite
angels, down from heaven to visit
her, and to reveal to her the secret
purpose of his divine pleasure. <i>Gabriel</i>,
on his first approach, addressed her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the following words, <i>Hail thou that art
highly favoured; the Lord is with thee;
blessed art thou among women</i>. <i>Mary</i>
thereupon was troubled and seemed
startled at this salutation. <i>Gabriel</i>, however,
bid her fear not, for that she had
found favour with God. <i>Behold</i>, said
he, <i>thou shalt conceive and bring forth
a son, and shalt call his name <span class="smcap">Jesus</span></i>.
At this she seemed still more surprised;
<i>How shall this be</i>, said she, <i>seeing I
know not a man?</i> Then <i>Gabriel</i> assured
her that the Holy Ghost should overshadow
her; and thereupon, with submission
to the divine will, she made the
following reply: <i>Behold the hand-maid
of the Lord; be it unto me according to
thy word</i>. At which time the Son of God
became incarnate, and was like unto
man, sin only excepted. At thirty
years of age he began to preach, and
his doctrine was most holy, and tends<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
only to the glory of God and good of
mankind. He wrought a great number
of miracles, which manifested an infinite
power and goodness. His life
was perfectly holy. We may find therein
an example of all kinds of virtue.
Jesus having lived after this manner
among the Jews, about four years, they
then put him to death; but he rose again
the third day after his death; and
forty days after his resurrection he ascended
into heaven, from whence he
sent the Holy Ghost to his apostles upon
the day of <i>Pentecost</i>.</p>

<h2><i>Christ’s Death.</i></h2>

<img src="images/illus7.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">The</span> blessed <span class="smcap">Jesus</span> being condemned
by <i>Pilate</i>, was crucified at a
place called <i>Golgotha</i>, between two
thieves. At his death the sun was
darkened, the earth shook, the vail of
the temple was rent in twain, the
graves opened, and many people who
had been dead appeared to their friends.
This great sacrifice was offered up for
out redemption on a <i>Friday</i>, the day of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
the Jewish passover, and the solemn
feast observed by the christian church
called <i>Good Friday</i>.</p>

<h2><i>The Ascension of Christ.</i></h2>

<img src="images/illus8.jpg" width="500" height="350" alt="" />

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">After</span> our Saviour’s death, his
body was embalmed and laid in
a sepulchre. On the third day, however,
which was <i>Sunday</i>, he arose triumphant
from the grave, and ascended into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
heaven before the eyes of his blessed
apostles, with whom he promised to
be ever present to the end of the world.
He now sits at the right-hand of God
the Father Almighty, and there is continually
interceding for us poor sinners,
and so will continue to do, till he shall
descend from heaven in all his glory,
to judge both the quick and the dead
at the last day.</p>

<h2><i>Description of St. Paul’s Church.</i></h2>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="upper">The</span> foundation of this Cathedral
was first laid by <i>Segbert</i>, a <i>Saxon</i>
king, in the year 610, and afterwards
much improved by one <i>Erkenwald</i>,
who was the 4th bishop of <i>London</i>.
The greatest part of it, however, together
with the whole city, was burnt
down in the year 1086. One <i>Mauritius</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
the 35th bishop, began to rebuild
it, and in the year 1221 it was completed.
It was then 690 feet long, the
body of it was 102 feet in height and
130 in breadth. The area three acres
and a half, and the tower in the middle
520 feet high, exclusive of a ball of
copper gilt, which was nine feet round,
whereon was a cross 15 feet and a half
high, and upon that an eagle of copper
gilt, which was 4 feet in length. In
this condition it continued till the
year 1666, at which unhappy time it
became once more a heap of ruins in
the second fire of <i>London</i>; but it was
soon after rebuilt at a vast expence, by
that ingenious and justly admired architect
the late Sir <i>Christopher Wren</i>. No
church (that of St. <i>Peter’s</i> of <i>Rome</i> only
excepted) can stand in competition
with it. It is near 500 feet in height.
It is principally composed of Portland<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
stone, and built according to the ancient
orders of <i>Greece</i> and <i>Rome</i>. The
inside is most beautifully adorned with
select historical paintings by the late
celebrated master, Sir <i>James Thornhill</i>.
The west front, and the two towers are
more beautiful than those of St. <i>Peter’s</i>.
The choir is spacious and very grand,
and the entrance to it, which is paved
with marble, is exceedingly beautiful.
The west door is the object of particular
admiration, and the north and south
porticos, as well as the pavement of the
church in general, are all excellent
performances.</p>

<p>The expence that attended the erection
of this magnificent Cathedral, the
glory of <i>England</i>, amounted (as appears
by an accurate estimate thereof laid before
the parliament in the year 1721)
to no less than eight hundred and ten
thousand pounds.</p>
